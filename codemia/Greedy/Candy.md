Candy
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings. You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements: Each child must have at least one candy. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors. Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:
Input: [1,0,2]
Output: 5

Two passes greedy: left-to-right satisfies left neighbor, right-to-left satisfies right neighbor.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

```
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(candies, 1);

        // Left to right pass
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
            }
        }

        // Right to left pass
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
            }
        }

        return Arrays.stream(candies).sum();
    }
}
